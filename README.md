# Granular-Spherical-Clustering
The present study proposes an approach to optimize the computational complexity of the spectral clustering algorithm based on the granular sphere structure. Additionally, it proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters in the spectral clustering process using the black-winged kite optimization algorithm.
